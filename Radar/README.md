# 📡 Radar Module

This module is intended for processing Radar sensor data, which can provide complementary information to LiDAR and Vision for object detection and tracking, particularly in adverse weather conditions.

## 🚧 Current Status
This `Radar` module is currently a **placeholder** within the Sensor Fusion project. Its implementation is minimal, and it is reserved for future development.

## 📂 Structure
Currently, this directory contains only basic initialization files. Detailed sub-directories and scripts will be added as the module is developed.

## 🚀 Setup & Execution
Specific setup and execution instructions for the Radar module will be provided once its development is underway. For now, please refer to the main project `README.md` for overall project installation.
